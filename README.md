# SN-Front-End
First Assignment

This is the first web development assignment on Github.

Task 1(Steps)

1. I log into my github account
2. I downloaded gitbash and,
3. and followed all the guide in the tutorial provided.

Task 2(Challenges)

1. At first, I missed the part where the facilitator mentioned downloading a gitbash so, I watched the video over and over again.
2. Another challenge I went through is logging in from the gitbash(That part that I was supposed to input my username and password). So when I refreshed my repository, there was no update like it showed in the tutorial.
